# Open in Visual Studio Code

Quickly find and open your projects in your preferred editor (Visual Studio Code, Vim, ...) from editor's history and local directories.

## Setup

Please review and fill the [Workflow’s Configuration](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/user-configuration/).
For most people, only two fields need to be configured:

- **Editor**: The default editor for opening projects 
- **Project Root:** Set a directory as the root to scanning local projects. If this field is not provided, this workflow only find projects from editor's workspaces (aka. recently opened projects).
