# Migrating from V1 to V2

The v2.x of this workflow has many breaking changes compared to the v1.x version:

1. The minimum supported version is Alfred 5. And the latest workflow no longer supports [Alfred 4](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/v4/). Please consider upgrade to Alfred 5 or use the [old version](https://github.com/hangxingliu/open-in-vscode-workflow/tree/v1.2.0) of this workflow.
2. All configurations via the environment variables and the file `~/.open-in-vscode.json` are no longer supported. Please use built-in configuration panel to configure them in an easy way. (Click the "Configure Workflow ..." to open the configuration panel)
